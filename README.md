# Binary-Search-Tree
# The Challenge
Your company needs you to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) - using the language of your choice - which will be utilized by other teams in your organization. Initially, this BST only needs to support integers and must include all methods of a BST. Additionally, include a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth, and include a method for building the BST from an array of integers.
# Requirements
* Implement a BST and all its methods
* The BST must be built from an array of integers
* Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth

# Deepest Node and Depth Example:

	Input: 12,11,90,82,7,9
	Output: deepest, 9; depth, 3	Input: 26, 82, 16, 92, 33
	Output: deepest, 33, 92; depth, 2
